## Project setup
First, make sure you have npm installed. I used version 6.9.0, but any version probably works.

I would also use Visual studio code with the *Vetur* extension.

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your tests
```
npm run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
